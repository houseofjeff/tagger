This text is a combination of etexts, one from the now-defunct ERIS project at Virginia Tech and one from Project Gutenberg's archives. The proofreaders of this version are indebted to The University of Adelaide Library for preserving the Virginia Tech version. The resulting etext was compared with a public domain hard copy version of the text. While we're here, let's toss out San Antonio, because that's a city.  How about Tampa Bay or Seattle while we're at it?  Cedar City maybe?
